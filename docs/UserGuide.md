## Introduction

Attention all freelancers, here is an application you have always wanted, but never got to experience!

We freelancers are always busy managing multiple projects at once. On top of that, each project comes with its own tasks and deadlines. This list is endless, but sadly, our brain capacity is exhausive.

As freelancers ourselves, we understand. We too have had times where we woke up feeling fresh, before realising (with a shiver down our spine) that we have completely forgotten about a certain project deadline. 

This is why we have developed an application for freelancers, and freelancers only. 

Leave it to Momentum to do the following for you:
* **Organisation of Projects**
    * View projects’  sub-tasks, deadline, description with just a few keystrokes.
    * Find any projects and task in Momentum with a single command.
    * Sort projects in different orders to your convenience at any time.
* **Project Management**
    * Set reminders to remind you of upcoming deadlines.
* **Time Management**
    * Keep track of how much time you have been spending on each project using our time-tracking tools.
    * Gain insights into your time usage with our statistics feature.
* **Personalisation**
    * Personalise Momentum’s settings to fit your preference.

We present you Momentum, the application that will make sure you never lose your momentum in your work ever again.

Momentum is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application equipped with Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is interactive, visually appealing, and easy to use. This means everything within our application can be done with just your keyboard, which provides a user-friendly experience for you.

This command allows you to sort the list of displayed projects or tasks in a particular sort type and order.

Format: `sort [type/SORT_TYPE] [order/SORT_ORDER] [c/]`

* There are 3 sort types.
  * `type/alpha` will sort the list of projects in alphabetical order.
  * `type/deadline` will sort the list of projects according to their deadlines.
  * `type/created` will sort the list of projects according to their date of creation.

* There are 2 sort orders.
  * `order/asc` will sort the list of projects in ascending order.
  * `order/dsc` will sort the list of projects in descending order.

In addition to the above sort types and orders, the list can be sorted by completion status.
* This is the "dominant sort" that will ensure that all incomplete projects/tasks are above complete projects/tasks, before sorting the projects/tasks in the specified sort type and order above.
* The default sort order will sort the projects/tasks by completion status.
* `sort c/` will toggle the default completion status sort.
    * Once the completion status sort is off, the projects/tasks will be sorted in the specified sort type and order without regard for their completion status.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: 
* When the application first starts, the completion status order is on. This completion status sort status (on/off) is maintained until it is toggled.
* `type/alpha` and `order/asc` will be used as default if both sort type and order are not specified (i.e. command is `sort`)
* For both `sort type/deadline` and `sort type/created`, projects with the same deadline or same created date will be sorted in alphabetical order.
* For `sort type/deadline`, projects/tasks with deadlines will appear at the top of the list sorted in deadline order, while those without deadlines will be pushed to the end of the list sorted in alphabetical order

</div>

**Sorting by Default Order**

Format: `sort`

This sorts projects in default ascending alphabetical order.

The following walkthrough shows how you can sort projects in Momentum by the default order.

1. Key in command `sort` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Default Sort Step 1](images/DefaultSort1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:

3. All projects are ordered in default ascending alphabetical order with incomplete tasks showing up at the top of the list (Completion status sort is on).
![Default Sort Step 3](images/DefaultSort3.png)

##### Sorting With Completion Status Toggle

Format: `sort c/`

This toggles the completion status order i.e. if the completion status order is "on", the completion status order is turned "off", vice versa.

The following walkthrough shows how you can toggle the completion status order in Momentum.

1. Key in command `sort c/` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

![Toggle Completion Status Step 2](images/ToggleCompletionStatus2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in default ascending alphabetical order without regard for their completion status.
![Toggle Completion Status Step 3](images/ToggleCompletionStatus3.png)

##### Sorting with Only Type Specified

`order/asc` is assumed if the `order` is not specified.
Hence, this sorts projects by the specified sort type, in ascending order.

Format: `sort type/SORT_TYPE`

Example: `sort type/deadline`

The following walkthrough shows how you can sort projects in Momentum by specifying only the sort type.

1. Key in command `sort type/deadline` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

3. All projects are ordered in ascending deadline order.
![Deadline Sort 3](images/DeadlineSort3.png)

##### Sorting With Only Order Specified

The current sort type is assumed if the `type` is not specified.
If there is no existing project order (when the application restarts), order will be alphabetical by default.

Format: `sort order/SORT_ORDER`

Example: `sort order/dsc`

The following walkthrough shows how you can sort projects in Momentum by specifying only the sort order.

1. Key in command `sort order/dsc` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Deadline Sort Descending 1](images/DeadlineDescending1.png)
Note that currently the projects are sorted in ascending deadline order.
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Deadline Sort Descending 2](images/DeadlineDescending2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in descending deadline order.
![Deadline Sort Descending 3](images/DeadlineDescending3.png)

##### Sorting With Both Type and Order Specified

This sorts projects in the specified type and order.

Example: `sort type/created order/dsc`

The following walkthrough shows how you can sort projects in Momentum by specifying both sort type and order.

1. Key in command `sort type/created order/dsc` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Created Descending 1](images/CreatedDescending1.png)
Note that the projects are not sorted by descending created date order.
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Created Descending 2](images/CreatedDescending2.png)
3. All projects are ordered in descending created date order.
![Created Descending 3](images/CreatedDescending3.png)
Note that for projects with the same created date, they are sorted in descending alphabetical order.

#### Filtering Projects: `find`

Done by Balasubramaniam Praveen

Momentum allows you to make detailed searches for projects or tasks based on a combination of their name, description, tags and completion status. This is done using the find command.

Format: `find [match/FILTER_TYPE] [n/NAME [MORE_NAMES]...] [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [t/TAG [MORE_TAGS]...] [c/COMPLETION_STATUS]`

Let us now take a look at how to make simple searches using the find command. Advanced searches that utilize the match parameter will be discussed later. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
You can only search for projects in the project view and tasks in the tasks view

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
Search parameters are not case sensitive.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
The projects/tasks in Momentum will no longer be filtered after the `Add`, `View` or `Home` Commands are used.
They will continue to be filtered after the `Edit` and `Delete` Commands are used.
</div>

##### Searching by Name

* The `n/` command checks whether a project has a certain name. There can be multiple names added to this command. For example, `n/car window` will check for the projects that contain `car` or `window` in their names.
* Searching by name only requires a partial match. This means that a project with the name `carpet` and `car` can potentially be the result of searching for the term `car`.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for projects with `ad` in their names.

1. Key in the command `find n/ad` in the command window.
![Find by Name Step 1](images/FindByName1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Name Step 2](images/FindByName2.png)
3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name will be shown.
![Find by Name Step 3](images/FindByName3.png)

##### Searching by Description

* The `d/` command checks whether a project has a certain description. There can be multiple descriptions added to this command. For example, `d/sunday october` will check for the projects that contain `sunday` or `october` in their description.
* Searching by description only requires a partial match, similar to searching by name.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for projects with `discussion` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find d/discussion` in the command window.
![Find by Description Step 1](images/FindByDesc1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Description Step 2](images/FindByDesc2.png)
3. All projects that contain `discussion` in their description will be shown.
![Find by Description Step 3](images/FindByDesc3.png)

##### Searching by Tag

* The `t/` command checks whether a project has a certain tag. There can be multiple tags added to this command. For example, `t/freelance errands` will check for the projects that contain the tags `freelance` or `errands`.
* Searching by tags will require a full word match unlike searching by name or description. This means that searching for the tag `free` will not find a project with the tag `freelance`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
Searches for tags require a full match whilst partial matches are sufficient for searches by name and description.

</div>

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for projects with the tag `webdesign`.

1. Key in the command `find t/webdesign` in the command window.
![Find by Tag Step 1](images/FindByTag1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Tag Step 2](images/FindByTag2.png)
3. All projects that contain the tag `webdesign` will be shown.
![Find by Tag Step 3](images/FindByTag3.png)

##### Searching by Completion Status

* There are keywords, completed and incomplete for`c/KEYWORD`. Other keywords are not accepted.
* The `c/` command checks whether a project is completed. For example, `c/completed` will check for the projects that are completed.
* When `c/` is not specified, both complete and incomplete projects will be shown.

The following walkthrough shows how you can use the find command to search for projects that have been completed.

1. Key in the command `find c/completed` in the command window.
![Find by Completion Step 1](images/FindByCompletion1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Completion Step 2](images/FindByCompletion2.png)
3. All projects that are completed will be shown.
![Find by Completion Step 3](images/FindByCompletion3.png)

##### Searching by Multiple Keywords

You can search for projects or tasks with multiple keywords for names, descriptions and tags in a single search.

To do this, you can add all the keywords that you would like to search for in the command. For example, if you would like to
search for projects or tasks that contain either `discussion` or `drawing` in their descriptions, you can do so by searching using
the command `find d/discussion drawing`.

In this command, each keyword to search for is separated by a whitespace.

The following walkthrough shows you can use the find command to search for projects with `discussion` or `drawing` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find d/discussion drawing` in the command window.
![Find by Multiple Keywords Step 1](images/FindByMultipleKeywords1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Multiple Keywords Step 2](images/FindByMultipleKeywords2.png)
3. All projects that contain `discussion` or `drawing` in their description will be shown.
![Find by Multiple Keywords Step 3](images/FindByMultipleKeywords3.png)

You can use the same method to search for projects using multiple keywords for name or tags. However, this will not work with completion status. You can only search by one completion status. 

##### Searching by Multiple Parameters

So far, you have learnt how to search for projects that contain multiple keywords for a single parameter. But what if you want to search for projects by multiple parameters instead? 

Momentum makes it extremely easy for you to do that. 

To make such a search, all you need to do is add all the parameters you would like to search for in a single find command. You can think of this as combining mulitple find commands together. For example, if you would like to search for projects or tasks that contain either `certification` in their name or `discussion` in their description, you can do so by searching using the command `find n/certification d/discussion`.

The following walkthrough shows you can use the find command to search for projects that contain either `certification` in their names or `discussion` in their description.

1. Key in the command `find n/certification d/discussion` in the command window.
![Find by Multiple Parameters Step 1](images/FindByMultipleParameters1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Find by Multiple Parameters Step 2](images/FindByMultipleParameters2.png)
3. All projects that contain `certification` in their name or `discussion` in their description will be shown.
![Find by Multiple Parameters Step 3](images/FindByMultipleParameters3.png)

You can use the same method to search for projects by a combination of other parameters as well. You can also use multiple keywords for each parameter that allows for it as mentioned in the previous section. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
If a certain search type is used more than once, the latest entry will be used.
`find n/a n/b n/c` will only search for projects/tasks that contain`c` in their name.

</div>

##### Adding Match Type to Searches

So far, you have learnt how to make searches by multiple keywords and parameters. However, the searches shown so far show a project as long as there is any one keyword that matches it. But this might not be useful in some cases. What if you need to search for a project that matches all keywords, or does not match any of the keywords entered.

This is where match type comes in. Match type can be added to your find command in addition to the parameters you are searching by. 

There are three values for the `match` parameter.
  * `match/all` shows an entry only if **all** of the keywords and parameters provided in the user's input matches the entry.
  * `match/any` shows an entry as long as **any** of the keywords and parameters provided in the user's input matches the entry.
  * `match/none` shows an entry only if **none** of the keywords and parameters provided in the user's input matches the entry.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb: **Tip:**
`match/any` will be used if the `match` type is not specified.

</div>

This might be a little confusing, so let's dive right into an example. We'll look at the example `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm` and compare how match type affects the results displayed.

Let's first look at `match/any`. This match type shows an entry as long as any keyword matches the user's input. It is also the default behaviour of the find command. The following walkthrough shows how to use `match/any`. 

1. Key in the command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm match/any` in the command window.
![Match Any Step 1](images/MatchAny1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Match Any Step 2](images/MatchAny2.png)
3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name or `discussion` in their description or the tag `artcomm` will be shown.
![Match Any Step 3](images/MatchAny3.png)

As seen in the example above, an entry is shown as long as any one of the keywords matches the project. 

Let's now look at `match/all`. This match type shows an entry only if all keywords matches the user's input. The following walkthrough shows how to use `match/all`. 

1. Key in the command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm match/all` in the command window.
![Match All Step 1](images/MatchAll1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Match All Step 2](images/MatchAll2.png)
3. All projects that contain `ad` in their name and `discussion` in their description and the tag `artcomm` will be shown.
![Match All Step 3](images/MatchAll3.png)

As seen in the example above, an entry is only shown if all keywords matches the project. 

Finally, let's look at `match/none`. This match type shows an entry only if none of the keywords matches the user's input. The following walkthrough shows how to use `match/none`. 

1. Key in the command `find n/ad d/discussion t/artcomm match/none` in the command window.
![Match None Step 1](images/MatchAll1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully:
![Match None Step 2](images/MatchAll2.png)
3. All projects that do not contain `ad` in their name, `discussion` in their description and the tag `artcomm` will be shown.
![Match None Step 3](images/MatchAll3.png)

As seen in the example above, an entry is only shown if none of the keywords matches the project. 

The posibilities of using match type to enhance your searches is limitless. Here are some examples where `match/all` and `match/none` may come in handy.

1. If you have many projects and want to find a specific project, you can use `match/all` to narrow down your search results.
2. If you have many projects and want to find projects that are not part of a certain category, you can use `match/none` to narrrow down your search results.

### Time Tracking

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

You can track the time you spend working on a project or task by starting a timer when you start working, and then stopping the timer once you finish.

Momentum remembers each timer that you start/stop and uses this information to calculate statistics.

#### Starting a Timer for a Project: `start`

Format: `start ID`

* Starts a timer for the project or task at the specified `ID`.
* Only 1 timer can be running for each project or task at any time.
* You can refer to [`ID` Term](#id-term) for more information.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb:
You can run timers for more than one project or task concurrently, if you are multi-tasking.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:bulb:
You can run timers for a project separately from its tasks. This allows you to track the time you spent on the project as a whole, as well as the time spent on each individual task.

</div>

Example: `start 2`

Result: Starts a timer for the second project or task in the displayed list.

#### Stopping a Timer for a Project: `stop`

Format: `stop ID`

* Stops a running timer for the project or task at the specified `ID`.
* A timer can only be stopped if there is one already running.
* You can refer to [`ID` Term](#id-term) for more information.

Example: `stop 2`

Result: Stops the timer for the second project or task in the displayed list.

#### Active Timers Panel

On the left side of the window is the Active Timers Panel. This is where Momentum shows you all the timers that are currently running.

![ActiveTimersUI](images/ActiveTimersUI.png)
Figure X: Location of the Active Timers Panel.

This panel will show you the name of the project/task, as well as when the timer was started.

#### Time Tracking Example

Here is an example of how you can use the `start` and `stop` commands to track the time that you spend on a project.
Suppose that you are going to start working on the project "Alpharad Youtube Endcard", which is the first item shown below:

![TimerExample1](images/TimerExample1.png)

You can perform time tracking with the following steps:

1. To start the timer, type `start 1` into the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ![TimerExample2](images/TimerExample2.png)

2. You should see the following message in the result box, indicating that the timer has been successfully started.

    ![TimerExample3](images/TimerExample3.png)

3. You should also see the project's name and start time in the active timers panel:

    ![TimerExample4](images/TimerExample4.png)

   Now that the timer has been successfully started, you can proceed to do your work. You can also choose to close
 Momentum. The timer will continue to run even when Momentum is closed. Proceed to the next step when you are done
  with your work.

4. To stop the timer, type `stop 1` into the command box and press `Enter`.

    ![TimerExample5](images/TimerExample5.png)

5. You should see the following message in the result box, indicating that the timer has been successfully stopped.

    ![TimerExample6](images/TimerExample6.png)

6. You should also see that the project has been removed from the active timers panel:

    ![TimerExample7](images/TimerExample7.png)

8. The statistics panel (see [statistics](#statistics)) will also be updated to reflect the time that you have spent
 working on the
 project:

    ![TimerExample8](images/TimerExample8.png)

### Reminders

Done by Cheong Ying Yi Clara

* A reminder will be shown in the reminder panel of the sidebar at the date and time you specified.

* Momentum will remove the reminder in the project/task after it is shown in the sidebar.

* If you missed a reminder, it will be greyed out in the project/task.

* You can refer to [Walkthrough of Creating a Project](#walkthrough-of-creating-a-project) for more details on how you can add a reminder.

* You can refer to [Walkthrough of Dismissing a Reminder](#walkthrough-of-dismissing-a-reminder) for more details on how you can dismiss a reminder.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: If you set multiple reminders at the same date and time, Momentum will only show one of the reminders in the reminder panel and mark other reminders as missed.

</div>

### Undo/Redo

Done By Kang Su Min

The undo/redo feature can be thought of as a "history traversal" function. After the execution of every command (excluding `help` and `exit`), all data at that point in time is stored in your Momentum history log.
The undo and redo command allows you to traverse up or down this history log such that you can recover any data that has been stored in your Momentum history at any point in time.  

#### Undoing the Previous Command: `undo`

The undo command undoes the last command that was executed. You can recover all data before the last command was executed.

Format: `undo`

Example: `start 1`, `undo`

Result: Timer for project/task at index 1 is started, then stopped and removed after `undo` is executed.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can start a timer for a project, then undo the command.

1. Key in command `start 1` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Undo 1](images/Undo1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully, and the timer for that project will appear at the side panel.
![Undo 2](images/Undo2.png)
3. Key in command `undo` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Undo 3](images/Undo3.png)
4. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been undone successfully.
![Undo 4](images/Undo4.png)
5. The timer has been removed from the project. Timer is no longer running.
![Undo 5](images/Undo5.png)

#### Redoing the Previous Command: `redo`

The redo command redoes the last command that was previously undone. You can recover all data before the last `undo` command was executed.

Format: `redo`

Example: `sort type/deadline`, `undo`, `redo`

Result: Projects are first sorted by deadline, then the application is reset to the sorting order before sort command was executed when `undo` command is executed, then reset back to sort by deadline after `redo` command.

The following walkthrough shows how a user can start a timer for a project, then undo the command.

1. Key in command `sort type/deadline` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Redo 1](images/Redo1.png)
Note: The projects are currently sorted in alphabetical, ascending order (default order).
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been executed successfully. Projects are now sorted in ascending deadline order.
![Redo 2](images/Redo2.png)
3. Key in command `undo` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Redo 3](images/Redo3.png)
4. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been undone successfully. Projects are now sorted in their original order (alphabetical, ascending).
![Redo 4](images/Redo4.png)
5. Key in command `redo` in the command window then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
![Redo 5](images/Redo5.png)
6. The result box will display a message to indicate that the command has been redone successfully.
![Redo 6](images/Redo6.png)
7. Projects are again sorted in ascending deadline order.
![Redo 7](images/Redo7.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb:
* Undo/redo feature keeps track of changes in data, and hence will not work on `help` or `exit` command which do not change the data in the application.
* Redo command only works if the previous command is `undo`.

</div>

### Statistics

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

Momentum uses the data collected from your timers (see [time tracking](#time-tracking)) to calculate statistics. These
 statistics are automatically generated and updated whenever you make any changes to your projects and tasks, such as
  when you start or stop a new timer.
 These statistics can be seen in a panel on the left side of the window, as shown here:

![StatisticsUI1](images/StatsUI1.png)
Figure X: Location of the statistics panel

The statistics displayed correspond to the projects or tasks currently shown in the displayed list, and will automatically
 change when the items in the displayed list changes (such as when you find specific projects or sort the list of projects).

![StatisticsUI2](images/StatsUI2.png)
Figure X: The order of the statistics entries matches the order in the displayed list.

You do not need to use any additional commands to update or view the statistics.

#### Timeframes

Momentum only tracks your statistics within a particular timeframe. You can change the timeframe through the [settings](#settings).

Momentum allows you to track the time spent within these timeframes:

* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly

By default, the timeframe will be set to weekly.

Here are the statistics being tracked by Momentum:

#### Time Spent Per Project

This statistic tells you the total amount of time you have spent within the timeframe. For projects, this includes
 all the time you have spent on each individual task, as well as on the project as a whole.

![StatsUISplit](images/StatsUISplit.png)
Figure X: Sections of the statistics panel.

The statistics are displayed in 2 different formats:

1. **Pie Chart**: Shows the relative time spent on each project. Useful for comparing different projects and tasks. Projects
 and tasks with less time spent on them may not be shown.
2. **Table**: Shows the exact (in minutes) amount of time spent on each project. Useful for calculations.

### Settings

Done by Khoo De Hui

Momentum allows you to change various settings so that you can make the application more suited to your preferences. Currently, the settings which you can adjust are:
* The application GUI [theme](#user-interface-theme)
* The [timeframe](#timeframes) of the statistics shown

Format: `set [th/THEME] [st/TIMEFRAME]`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* There are two GUI themes available, Light and Dark. The keywords to apply them are:
  * `th/light`
  * `th/dark`
* There are three available timeframes for statistics, daily, weekly and monthly. The keywords to apply them are:
  * `st/daily`
  * `st/weekly`
  * `st/monthly`

Example: `set th/light st/monthly`

Result: Sets a light theme to the GUI and changes the statistics pane to show the time spent on projects within the month.

#### Walkthrough of Changing Application Settings
1. In order to set your GUI theme to light and your statistic timeframe to daily, type `set th/light th/monthly` in the command box and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute it.
 ![Settings Walkthrough Step 1](images/SettingsDiagram1.png)
2. The result box will display a message to indicate that your command has been executed successfully.
 ![Settings Walkthrough Step 2](images/SettingsDiagram2.png)
3. Your GUI has now been set to the light theme, and information in your statistics panel has been updated.
 ![Settings Walkthrough Step 3](images/SettingsDiagram3.png)

### Clear All Projects/Tasks : `clear`

Done by Farrell Nah Jun Hao

When you are viewing all projects, this command deletes all the projects in Momentum, including their tasks.

When you are viewing a specific project's tasks, this command will delete all the tasks in the project. The project
 itself will not be deleted.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning:
This command will also delete the saved data.
You can undo this operation while Momentum remains open.
However, you will not be able to undo this once you close Momentum.

Please be careful when using this command, as you may loose large amounts of your data.

</div>

Format: `clear`

3. The result box will display a message to indicate that all projects have been cleared. You should no long see any projects in the displayed list.

    ![ClearProject2](images/ClearProject2.png)

### Dismissing a Reminder : `dismiss`

Done by Cheong Ying Yi Clara

You can dismiss a reminder using this command.

Format: `dismiss`

Result: The reminder panel of the sidebar will be hidden.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: You cannot dismiss a reminder if the reminder panel of the sidebar is not visible.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: Momentum cannot show a reminder that you dismissed in the reminder panel again. You can undo a dismissal to show an expired reminder in the project/task.

</div>
